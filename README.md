mobility-app
============
Digital tool to increase housing mobility to higher-opportunity areas, designed with Connecticut Open Communities Alliance (http://ctoca.org) 

##Demo
- http://erinboggs.github.io/mobility-app/ OR http://jackdougherty.github.io/mobility-app

##How to copy this open-source code with GitHub
- Learn how to use free GitHub browser tool at http://epress.trincoll.edu/dataviz/host-html-github
- Create your own free GitHub account
- Go to original code repository (http://github.com/JackDougherty/mobility-app/) and click "fork" to copy to your own GitHub account

##How to host your code on live web with GitHub Pages
- After forking a copy, click on "branches" and keep "master" but delete any old "gh-pages" branches (click garbage can)
- Create your own fresh GitHub pages branch, which will host your live code on the public web. Go to "branch" drop-down menu and type "gh-pages" which will copy contents of master branch into a fresh new gh-pages branch. Within a few minutes, your new gh-pages branch should appear on the live web at this generic address: https://YourGitHubUsername.github.io/YourRepositoryName
- The live version initially may take 10-30 minutes to appear, but subsequent changes should appear within seconds.

##How to manage different branches with GitHub browser
- With two branches of the same code, one strategy is to make and test edits on the "gh-pages" live web branch, then save all of your changes to the "master" branch for safe-keeping
- Read about "pull requests" to migrate code from one branch to another at http://epress.trincoll.edu/dataviz/host-html-github

##Edit key files with GitHub (use "pencil" symbol to edit)
- index.html (to modify appearance of the search screen)
- js/maps_lib.js (to link to your Google Fusion Table data and modify search and results coding)
- css/custom.css (to modify styling)
- See general instructions about Searchable Map Template at http://derekeder.com/searchable_map_template/
